# DevPulse API Insights

Vite + React dashboard for API health monitoring and AgentGuard (AI agent cost control, leak detection, kill switch).

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` – your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` – your Supabase anon/public key
   - `APP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – comma-separated web origins allowed to call Supabase edge functions (include your production domain)

3. **Run development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   App runs at http://localhost:8080

4. **Supabase migrations**  
   Run `supabase db push` (or apply migrations) to create tables. The `user_api_keys` table is required for the api-proxy edge function.

5. **Supabase secrets (production)**
   Set required secrets before going live:
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (if using paid plans)
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (recommended)
